        <h3>Security of Information</h3>
        <p>Security of information ensures prevention of unauthorized access to information and corruption of content. Common threats to security of information include unauthorized access and by malicious software such as virus, worms, and trojan horses. While the former steal the information, the later cause corruption or loss of information.</p>
        <p>Computer hacking refers to gaining unauthorized access to a computer or network resources. A person does hacking is called a hacker or a cracker. A hacker is a person who gains unauthorized access toa computer for the porpose of fixing flaws whithin the system. Whereas, a cracker id one who gains unauthorized access to a computer for the purpose of stealing or corrupting data. </p>
        <p>The following are often used to prevent the security and intergrity of information:</p>
        <p><b>Password</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A password is a secret sequence of characters that enables a user to control access of a resource such as a computer, a program, or a file. To prevent unauthorized access we should not reveal our password to anyone, and should also make a strong password.</p>
        <p><b>Antivirus software</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It detects and removes virus and other mailicious software from a computer. It needs to be updated regularly to amintain its effectiveness.</p>
        <p><b>Firewall</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A firewall is a security system designed to protect a computer from hacker attacks. Users are generally advised to install an anti-spyware software and not click on e-mails received from unknown sourcesto avoid falling prey to such attacks.</p>
        <h3>Secure Data Transmission</h3>
        <p>The information security system in e-commerce should meet the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Privacy</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;No unauthorized person should be able to access the information.</li>
            <li><b>Authentication of sender and receiver</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sender and receipent msut prove their identities to each other.</li>
            <li><b>Intergrity and non-repudation</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The information must not be tampered with and there should be a proof that the information is intact.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Secure Sockets Layer(SSL)</h3>
        <p>SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today.</p>
        <p><b>Public and Private key encryption</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy of inf is handled by encryption. Encryption is the process of modifying data so that unauthorized users cannot read it. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back to human-readable form. This method solves the problem by creating a set of two different keys called a key pair. While one of the two keys is used to encrypt data the other can be used to decrypt data. The two keys in a key pair are as follow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Private key,</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the owner knows the private key.</li>
            <li><b>Public key</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is distributed to any user who requests it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Digital certificate</h3>
        <p>A Digital Certificate is an electronic "password" that allows a person, organizaion to exchange data securely over the Internet using the public key infrastructure (PKI). Digital Certificate is also known as a public key certificate or identity certificate. <br>
        The digital certificate typically includes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The name of the owner, its email address, and the URL of the web server.</li>
            <li>The owners public key.</li>
            <li>The name of the CA that issues the certificate.</li>
            <li>A serial number.</li>
            <li>The validity period of the certificate.</li>
            <li>The digital signature of the CA.</li>
        </ul>
