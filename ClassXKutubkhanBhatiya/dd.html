        <h2>Digital Divide</h2>
        <p>In today's world, there are people who do quite a bit of their personal and professional work or the computer and make use of the Internet extensivelyas routine matter. For example, people use e-banking, e-learning, and e-governance site, day in day out. In contrast, there are people who do not have access to computer or to the Internet, nor do they have adequate knowledge of using the facilites available on a computer or the Internet.</p>
        <p>The uneveness has resulted in what sociologist refer to digital divide.</p>
        <p><mark>Digital Divide refers to the gap between people who have knowledge as well as access to products of modern information technologies such as mobile phones, computers, and the Internet, and those who do not have access and the knowledge to use these devices and technologies.</mark></p>
        <p>The difference between these two classes of people with unequal technological priviliges leads to unequal sharing of resources of knowledge and useful information and, therefore, leads to unequal opportunities to improve their lives and buisness. Steps must be taken to digitally unite these two groups of people.</p>
        <p><b>Digital unification</b> regers to providing the same opportunities to all sections of people to access information technologies and the know-how to use the same.</p>
